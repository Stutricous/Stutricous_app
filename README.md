## Overview
### Description
Stutricous is an app that can recommend meals based on your general health goals. The goal is to integrate this with on campus food supplies so that way students can always have food and recipes in their pocket that they know they can always look at. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category: Health and Fitness and Social Networking
- **Mobile: This app would be primarily created for a moblie applicaiton; however, it could surely be ported onto a website version. Additionally, the application could be created on Andriod as well. 
- **Story: User creates a food emphasis and meals are shown on their feed. Additionally, they can communicate with friends and other people on campus to discuss anything related to meals + health and fitness.  
- **Market: The market could be anyone, but there is a general focus towards students who are currently on a college campus. 
- **Habit: This app could be used everyday and as often as the user wants to. Health is important everyday, and this app can help with that. 
- **Scope: First we want to see if we can pull together APIs and technologies to make this applicaiton work
